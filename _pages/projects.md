  * List item two
  * List item three
  * List item four


## 3. **Unsupervised Low-Light Depth Estimation**

### 4. **Model Pruning: Lottery Ticket Hypothesis** 
  *	Trained a lightweight model M1 and Resnet18 on CIFAR-10 to perform model pruning experiments in PyTorch.
  *	Observed that M1 is 40% sparse & Resnet18 is only 20% sparse using the L1Unstructured method of pruning. 
  *	Performed iterative pruning on models with 40-80% sparsity for faster training convergence.
  *	Found that the network was able to re-achieve original train accuracy within 1-2% error.
  *	Concluded that iterative pruning has better model generalizability and better accuracy on the validation set.
