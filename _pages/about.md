I am an MS ECE student at the University of California Los Angeles (UCLA) in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering. I focus on learning and applying cutting-edge techniques and methods in the field of artificial intelligence and image processing. I have a strong academic background in my field of interest, having graduated from the Indian Institute of Technology, Madras (IIT Madras).

I am passionate about exploring and solving deep learning and imaging-based problems and their applications in day-to-day life. I have worked as a research assistant in two prestigious labs, one at IIT Madras and one at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. As a result, I have gained valuable skills and experience in computer vision and image processing. I am actively looking for Summer 2024 Internships that will allow me to further develop and showcase my skills and competencies in this domain.
