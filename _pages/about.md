I am a first-year M.S. student in Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) at [University of California Los Angeles (UCLA)](https://www.ucla.edu/). I obtained my Bachelors degree in Electrical Engineering at the [Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Madras](https://www.iitm.ac.in/) in India.

My research interest broadly lie within the domain of **Computer Vision** and **Imaging**. The broad sub-topics which align with my experience are Generative methods, Diffusion Models, 3D Vision, Stereo Depth estimation and Image Segmentation. I am keen to explore the fields of domain adaptation, multi-modal learning, vision-language methods and designing intelligent systems for ADAS.



_**Actively looking for Summer 2024 internship roles in the areas of Software Engineering, Machine Learning and Applied Sciences**_
