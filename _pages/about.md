I am a first-year M.S. student in Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) at [University of California Los Angeles (UCLA)](https://www.ucla.edu/). I obtained my Bachelors degree in Electrical Engineering at the [Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Madras](https://www.iitm.ac.in/) in India.

My research interest broadly lie within the domain of **Computer Vision** and **Imaging**. The broad sub-topics which align with my experience are Generative methods, Diffusion Models, 3D Vision, Stereo Depth estimation and Image Segmentation. I am keen to explore the fields of domain adaptation, multi-modal learning, vision-language methods and designing intelligent systems for ADAS.

I previously interned at [Vision and AI Lab (VAL)](https://val.cds.iisc.ac.in/) wherein I focused on projects related to Generative AI and 3D scene synthesis. During my bachelors, I had the opportunity to collaborate with [Prof. Kaushik Mitra](https://www.ee.iitm.ac.in/kmitra/) at the [Computational Imaging Lab](https://www.ee.iitm.ac.in/comp_photolab/) on problems based on Unsupervised Stereo Depth Estimation. I was also fortunate to have the opportunity to work with [Prof. Mohit Gupta](https://wisionlab.com/people/mohit-gupta/) on a specialized field of Single Photon Cameras (SPC) and its Application in Depth Estimation.
